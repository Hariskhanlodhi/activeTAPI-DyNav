Release Notes                                                    06.11.2009

activeTAPI 4.20 (unchanged) for 
  Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009, Service Pack 1
  Date: 06.11.2009
  Time: 10:00:00  

The follwing changes were made in Navision:
  Version: AT2009


0) Navision License

You have to add Codeunit 56782 to the Navision License
for the Single-Instant Codeunit "TAPI FUnctions SI"
(see point 2).


1) TAPI Logs

In the TAPI Logs in Navision everybody can see all logged calls.
Some customers did not like that. 
A new option was introduced: "See TAPI Logfile completely" in 
"User Setup" (Table 91 and Form 119).
Form 56784 "TAPI Logs" was modified: 
- The option is not active: The user sees only his own calls.
- The option is active: The user sees his own calls, but he can 
  click on "Show all".
A new key "User,Entry No." was introduced to Table 56780 
"TAPI Logfile" and to Form 56784 "TAPI Logs".

In the Form 56784 "TAPI Logs" you find a new button: Dial.
So you are able to make a phone call directly out of the Log.
For outgoing calls, the "Called ID" will be called, for incoming
calls the "Caller ID" will be called.


2) Formatting of Phone and / or Fax No.'s

This tasks were performed in the Codeunit 56780 "TAPI Functions". 
Each time when a number was formatted, a new Automation object had
to be created and to be initialized. This could last some seconds.
Therefore the formatting function (ConvToCanonic) was transferred 
from Codeunit 56780 to a new Single-Instant-Codeunit 56782 
"TAPI Functions SI". So formatting is directly available.
The Codeunit 56782 is allways started in CU 1 ApplicationManagement
(LogInStart).
The change from Codeunit 56780 to 56782 was introduced in Table 
18 "Customer", Table 23 "Vendor", Table 5050 "Contact" and Codeunit
56780 "TAPI Functions".

By the way: If you want to format ALL Phone, 2. Phone, Fax No.'s, etc.
in Navision, here is a list of all tables with such numbers:

3) Check for double numbers

If you input a phone no., a check is performed: Does this number allready 
exists in the phone index. If yes, you get a warning message.
Some users did not want this kind of check.
Therefore there is the new field "Check of double numbers" with the options
"allways,only unblocked numbers,never" in the TAPI Setup (Table 56782,
Form 56782).
allways:                Check against all existing numbers in the phone 
                        index - as it is now. 
only unblocked number:  If customers and vendor are blocked (with Option) all,
                        their numbers are not part of the check.
never:                  No check for double numbers is performed.
The information of the field "blocked" has to be transferred to the
Phone-Index. 
Changes in:
Table 18 "Customer":             Modify PhoneIndex, if Blocked is changed
Table 23 "Vendor":               Modify PhoneIndex, if Blocked is changed
Table 56781 "Phone Index":       New Field "Blocked"; Field "Blocked" added to 
                                 all Index-Keys
Report 56780 "Fill Phone Index": Check double Numbers options, fill new field "Blocked"
CU 56780 "TAPI Functions":       Field "Blocked" in Phone Index (Customer / Vendor)
                                 Check for double numbers defined in Setup


4) Interaction Log Entry (Aktivitätsprotokollposten)

Some user use the Interaction Log and they would like to use it together 
with activeTAPI.
So we introduced the new Field "Create Interaction Log Entry" in "TAPI Setup"
(Table 56782 and Form 56782).
If this option is activated, you will find the button "Create Interact. Log"
(Akt.-Protokoll erst.) on Form 56789 "End of Call out", if a contact
was found in NAV for the called Phone No.
If you click button "Create Interact. Log", the wizzard of Form 5147 
"Make Phone Call" is opened on page 2.
All available informations of the finished call are transferred to the 
wizzard and additional information (Campaign, etc.) can be added.
Changes in: 
CU 56780 "TAPI Functions":       Option Create Interaction Log Entry


5) Call back

In Form 56789 "End of call out" you find allready the button "Dial again",
if the call was not connected.
We added a button "Call back" to the Form 56788 "End of call in". It is
activated, if the caller was found in Navision.


6) Action for end of call

Some users do not want to see a form "End of call .." at the end of a call.
Therefore we added two new field to "TAPI User" (Table 56783 and Form 56783): 
- Action for end of incom. call     Options: Reference/Note,none
- Action for end of outgo. call     Options: Reference/Note,none
The option "Reference/Note" shows the forms 56788 "End of Call in" or 56789 
"End of Call out" as it does now.
The option "none" shows nothing an the end of an incoming or outgoing call.
Changes in:
CU 56781 "TAPI Main": Options from TAPI User for Action for end of incom. 
                      call, Action for end of outgo. call

7) Tracing

Since the beginning of activeTAPI, you have the possibility to trace actions 
in Navision to a log-file called "Navi_log.txt" in the LogFiles directory 
of activeTAPI.
To show how ist works, we have added 3 blocks of creating trace-informations
(outcommented) in CU 56781 "TAPI Main".
