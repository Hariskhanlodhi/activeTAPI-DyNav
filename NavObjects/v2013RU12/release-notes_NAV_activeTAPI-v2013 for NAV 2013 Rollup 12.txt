Release Notes                                                    10.04.2014

activeTAPI.COM-DyNav_v2013_Setup.msi
  installs activeTAPI.COM-DyNav v2013

The NAV objects are based on NAV 2013 with RollUp 1 and were developed with
Build 34587.

If you are working with a newer Rollup, a newer Version of the NAV Objects is
avaliable based on Rollup 12 (Build 36207). 
The .fob and .txt-files for Rollup 12 habe -R12- in their name:
- AT-v2013-R12-modified-standard-objects.fob
- AT-v2013-R12-modified-standard-objects.txt
- AT-v2013-R12-new-objects.fob
- AT-v2013-R12-new-objects.txt

The activeTAPI-Installation-Program is the same for all the Rollups and it is
included in the Download of activeTAPI-v2013.

Install activeTAPI, import the new and changed standard objects to a
Chronus database. In a second step you import the objects for Rollup 12.
And you compile all objects with version filter *AT*.



The follwing changes were made in Navision:
  Version-Code: AT2013

1) The Classic Client died

Bye, bye, dear old friend, we loved you ...
... and we begin to love RTC with NAV 2013 

So everything called FORM was changed to PAGE.
Also "IF ISSERVICETIER THEN" was deleted.

Remember before you start:
- Register the Timer-AddIn (see separat documentation 
  "Getting started" (chapter 3.1).
- To start the timer-page with every call of the RTC, in the properties of 
  the RTC-Desktop Icon please add after the programm call 
  ... \Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.exe" "DynamicsNAV:////RunPage?Page=56785"
  This will start the RTC and the Page with timer. You can do that for every user. 
  If the user is not working with activeTAPI, the Timer-page will close 
  directly after opening.
- It is not possible, to change the code behind the Telephone-Icons (behind
  the Phone No.-fields). Therefore we had to use a trick: We used the 
  OnAssistEdit-Trigger.
  Thats why you don't see the Telephone-Symbol, but 3 points. If you click 
  on the 3 points, NAV dials.
- You find all the Telephony menu options in "Departments".

One hint:

In the List Pages (Customer, Vendor, Contact) there is a new Page Action "Dial". 
It dials the main number ("Phone No.") of the actual line.
It is promoted and we used Image Calls.


2) Older Versions of NAV

In the future we will have several versions of activeTAPI:
- activeTAPI-DyNAV v2011.3   for all NAV versions from 2009 SP2 with CC and RTC
- activeTAPI-DyNAV v2013     for all NAV version 2013
- and very soon a version for NAV 2013 R2


3) Known Issues

- Pages do not have a MinimizeOnOpen-Property. Therefore Page 56785 "Page with Timer" 
is allways opened and must be minimized manually (not closed).

- Since NAV version 2013 there is a problem with "Send to Excel". If you start
a single instant codeunit with an automation object inside (and activeTAPI does),
"send to Excel" hangs. Up to Rollup 12 this bug was not yet corrected by Microsoft
(in NAV 2012 R2 it is corrected). But we are still talking with the Microsoft 
Support about this issue. May be in one of the next Rollups it will be corrected ...


4) Feed back

We hope you enjoy the new version. Don't hesitate to give us hints, proposals, ...


Best regards
M. Gertz
