Release Notes                                                    02.12.2014

activeTAPI.COM-DyNav_v2015_Setup.msi
  installs activeTAPI.COM-DyNav v2015

The NAV objects are based on NAV 2015 (first delivery) and were developed with
Build 37847.

If you use activeTAPI with NAV 2013 R2, there is one issue after the installation
of activeTAPI:
The activeTAPI-Timer-Control-Addin "activeTAPI.RTC TimerControl.dll" is 
installed in the path:
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics NAV\70\RoleTailored Client\Add-ins.
This is wrong. It must be the new path
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics NAV\71\RoleTailored Client\Add-ins
So you will have to copy it from the old to the new path. We will fix this issue
with the next version of activeTAPI-Installer.


1) The follwing changes were made in Navision:
The Version-Code is AT2015.

a) There were some troubles with NAV 2013 (R2) and the Excel-Addin.
To avoid this, we added a .NET-Check in Codeunit 40 (thanks to Cajus).

b) In Report 56780 "Fill Phone Index" there was no Request Page. It was added now.

c) In Page 56784 "TAPI Logs" there is a page action "Dial" (Anrufen). The Code was 
changed. Now always the Remode ID is dialed (if not empty).

d) In the Table 56782 TAPI Setup there is new field "Runs in Developer Mode".
This field can only be changeld directly in the table (developers should know 
how to do this ...).
If it is activated, activeTAPI automation object "TAPI Functions SI" is not 
started in Codeunit 40, LoginStart.
So Developers, that have not installed activeTAPI, will not get automation
errors anymore. But take care: You should also deactivate "Format Phone Numbers"
and "Format Fax Numbers" in the TAPI SetUp. Otherwise you will get automation
errors, if you change any Phone No.
AND: Don't forget, to deactivate "Runs in Developer Mode" at the end of your work.


2) Older Versions of NAV

In the future we will have three different versions of activeTAPI:
- activeTAPI-DyNAV v2011.3   for all NAV versions from 2009 SP2 with CC and RTC
- activeTAPI-DyNAV v2013     for all NAV version 2013 and R2
- activeTAPI-DyNAV v2015     for NAV version 2015


3) Known Issues

a) Pages do not have a MinimizeOnOpen-Property. Therefore Page 56785 "Page with Timer" 
was allways opened and had to be minimized manually.

4) Feed back

We hope you enjoy the new version. Don't hesitate to give us hints, proposals, ...


Best regards
M. Gertz
